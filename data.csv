Detailed review after Using it for 3 days. This was the first time with Boult. I have used 6 bluetooth neckbands - Samsung Level U, Samsung Level U Pro, Anchor Soundbuds, Anchor Souncore and Boat Rockers 255 R. Each products were best in some of their features but was poor in durability. I am running a Plywood shop and I do loading and unloading most times. Every time I used these wired bluetooth neckbands.., I was having problems with those wires. That's why I went for a True Wireless Headset. At that time I was tensed. My tension was whether keeping an earpod in the ear is safe..! There's a high risk of losing the bud. Even companies says the bud will not fall.. So I searched for a true wireless earbud with earloop. Then I saw Boult Audio Truefive Pro. I have a bad habit of sweating continuously. After reading all the specs I decided to order it. Orderd it on 29th June via Amazon and I got it on 1st July.Now I am saying my review on Boult Audio TruefivePro on my Usage. First thing was the design of the Charging Case. Matt Black finished Cute one. The design of the earbud is simply awesome. The material that Boult used as Earloop... - Fell in love with that material. It is not so hard not so soft. That supercool Earloop keeps the earbud in the ear safely always. You can run or do whatever you like. The bud will not fall. Sound was awesome. Polite bass and crystal clear voice. There's a safe feeling when it's in the ear. When I take calls.., my voice is super clear. Simple and Powerful mic. Both earpod can be used at the same time or as single at calls or you listen music. The Last but not least.., but so important matter is its battery Backup. I Charged the case fully at the first time. Till now I use earpods and then I put them into the case. Not charged them yet. I have used A single earpod without changing even within the case for a whole day.(Not continuously playing music)Anyway I am so happy about this purchase and will say it will worth each rupees you spend for this product. And one more important factor is about the Boult. One of the staff from Boult called me and enquired about the purchase. Thanks for that support.Read more
Misleading company. The build quality is good and the sound is average for this price. But do not be misled into believing this is a qualcomm 3020 earphone (as per the description). There is noticeable delay in audio. But it gives better sound than most due to aac codec. My advice is to look for cheaper options which will give the same features. But the packaging and finish of the product is excellent. So it can make a really good gift.Read more
Well, In one line, This is an Amazing product.1. Bass Effect : Veey Deep2. Acoustics: Well balanced3. Music: You'll fall in love4. Case: Looks premium and well designed.5. Battery Backup: It'll be more than you expected practically.6. Design: Fits very well in any size of ears.Haven't tested IPX7 yet. But I'm sure that the results will be on satisfactory level.Ultimately, if you're a music lover and your range is around 3K, then this is a must buy product.Read more
Good earphone, works in mono mode (connecting each piece to two different devices). Call quality is also good with mic being loud and clear. Note though not mentioned in the product description, the charging box is now magnetic.No button on box now to press, as soon as you put the ear pieces in, it starts charging.Read more
As many other users have already pointed out, these earbuds don't seem to have any Qualcomm aptx support as claimed in the product description.1. They are otherwise decent earbuds in this price range. They have decent sound quality and amazing battery life compared to other brands.2. They feel comfortable in ears and are relatively lightweight. the ear hooks are good for exercising and they will not fall out of your ears for sure. The bass is good as they have 9mm audio drivers.3. The charging case has a premium look and feel to it and gives a really decent battery backup.4. The noise cancellation in these earbuds is passive and therefore totally depends upon the shape of your ear for how good it is for you. The silicone earbuds are comfortable and soft and you get 2 extra ear hooks(Green and Pink) and 2 extra earbuds(Small and Large) in the box.5. They do not have any Qualcomm aptx support and I have tested this with multiple Qualcomm aptx supported phones. The highest available codec for them is AAC and that's all. The company is falsely claiming the feature on the product description page and Amazon should look into it urgently.I have requested for a replacement from Amazon hoping that maybe the product that I received was defective. I will update this review once I receive the replacement and test them.UPDATE: So I received the replacement and it doesn't have Qualcomm aptx support either. The replacement is even worse and doesn't even support AAC now. I think Amazon noticed the false claim and therefore has removed the Qualcomm aptx support claim from the product description page. I am going to return these as the main buying point for me was the Qualcomm aptx feature which greatly reduces the lag in any bluetooth earbuds. Really disappointed with this purchase and will not be buying this again.Read more
1.The product does not have Qualcomm aptX, it is still showing AAC even when I tried changing it in the Developer options. The company is making fake claims.2.Also the buds are not comfortable as they are bigger than other TWS which causes too much pain as the TWS enter inside your ears even more when you try to press any button.3. Lastly, the back side of the box says 'Tru5ive' and not 'Tru5ive pro'.I suggest do not go for this item, rather buy hrx x drops 9gRead more
Issues faced from first day...1. There is a lag2. Left ear bud is not at the same volume3. Volume is low... Like really really low compared to my sennheiser wired ear phones4. Bluetooth connectivity issues. Fluctuations in connectivity. Very frustrating5. Not the most snug to wear. Especially while lying down with your head on the pillow.Buy at your own risk...Read more
