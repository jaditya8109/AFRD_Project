So far loving it! Value for money.1. Description mentios Ethernet Port, but that isn't there.2. Highlights mentions Inking Pen, but that isn't there.3. Pavillion series does not come with Gorilla Glass protection.4. Screen brightness is 250 nits, Full HD5. Laptop bag is not part of accessoriesAfter 1.5 months usage review:1. Easy to carry, size and weight wise2. Good touch screen with sufficient loudness3. Good battery backup 4 to 5 hours4. Good for office use (WFH) and also for personal use (media)5. No heating issues found
The product misses Ink pen which is very important for a touch enabled laptop. THe product is not as described. Contacted seller but no use.
The product is as per expectations. Best 2 in 1 laptop in this range. I needed this for heavy reading, note making, operating on Excel sheet and coding. Could not afford to buy a tablet separately. Though it is a bit heavy and less ergonomic for reading, but considering all other benefits in a single device it is best.
I faced heating issue after 3 days and it got replacedbut the problem is severe with the second oneThere is some problem with the model itselfBetter not to buy this
Pro:-It looks great üëçFingerprint unlock working wellSound is loud with good qualityHave bright light in keyboardBattery is also good 5-8 hour according to your usesYou will not get any warranty card from Amazon but every product is eligible for 1yr warranty.Cons:-Office products are not activated it's showing after 10 days some features will blockIf you are big fan of Alexa then you need to click on Alexa button and then say so it's not fully handsfree,You can listen fan noise when doing heavy work, little heatingAlso extra care is needed as it's screen is of glassDon't get any bag with this, no stylus penNo antiglare screen but you can buy antiglare screen protector onlineIt's only 2 day I got this if any other issue I don't know
Product is good.pro- slim and trimtouch response is good enough.touch pad is responging goodSuper fast booting and shut downcons-key board letters marking is very light, in dim light it make problem to see letters.
Good things: Product is good at this price range. Touch is smooth. Biomatric recognition is fast and accurate. Keyboard is so much smooth. I literally enjoyed typing on this. Battery charging speed- 8% to 90% in 1.5 hours then it takes time to reach at 100%.Negative points: Power button is in side. So when you pick the laptop or while converting into tablet mode, you may accidentally press the button and screen turns off. Happened with me 2 times. Whole space of 476 GB is partioned as C Drive only.Review after using for 3 hours- Sound is low. If you are not alone in the room, then You need to have either headphone or external sound to watch any video. Screen is not that much bright. Heating issue is there but not too much.Review after using for 6-7 hours of usage - Seems like processor is slow. I was making a file in ms word, so it takes 3-4 seconds to save the file everytime when I press control+s. Also felt leg in opening browsers and other applications.
Nice laptop. Stylus would have been good...incorrect description on the product showing it as coming along with stylus.
My experience after one month of use: This laptop is super fast compared to specification. There is no lag while switching on or login or shutdown. All applications are working smoothly without lag. Screen is bright and clear. Sound is loud and good. Keyboard backlight is very helpful during night use. Fingerprint scanner is fast.Only thing i wanted in this laptop is black colour keyboard. Letters are generally much clearer and visible in a black colour keyboard.
1 week of use : Moderate use not for gaming and high performance required software:Pros:Good battery life.Good performanceAmazing lookMaterial is plastic but good quality.Good for Office work.Cons:Should come with some basic accessories:Active/stylus penBeg and screen and keyboard protector.Overall good laptop so far with moderate of use.
