Before buying you must know the difference between 7k mobile and 10k to 15K Mobiles .Reason for choosing this title earlier i used a pro version model , Now i am reviewing this model after 3 days of usage.1. Ear speaker quality in outdoor's very poor. Keep your headphones handy ,2.Sensor's are not working properly ( this is the reason i choose this title , sensor quality is based on price )3.App search option is not available, you must be very patient to search required app when you have an urgent need , you have to swipe all your mobile to choose required app . or change the launcher . default launcher is not capable of doing this basic function .Rest all other functions are good.Read more, 1.0 out of 5 stars, shankar k. 
Worst phone ever. Don't buy ths phone.heating issue at the bottom side of touch screen, touch button as well as ghost touch activates on its own within 1-2 minutes and you can not use any of the app properly.Initially thought it may be a due to some kind of virus, even after company reset issue is there and also you can see screen flickering very easily.Read more, 1.0 out of 5 stars, dharmen shah 
This is my 4th MI Phone in 3 years. Earlier ones were good.But here The extra battery has made phone heavier and hence has lost it charm, now looks like chinese phone. Earlier ones were as good as other phone apart from brand.Not recommended.Would love to return but it was gift for family,Read more, 1.0 out of 5 stars, Zen
