Here my product review after usage of 3 months.Cons:If you bought this mobile you can't exchange. I have tried but not able to exchange my device.Please check by clicking the exchange option and you can take the decision.Now you can understand why you should not by this mobile.Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics gameBattery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate performFor charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100.Macro camera - useless featureFront and Rear camera - Not good compare with realme 6000rs mobile camera.UI is fine but consuming more ramMany pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).I suggest please buy some other brand don't waste your money like me.Read more
Worst product, not as expected its not even a month and ut hangs so much! Its front camera is just worst, only it's first look is good nothing else. Don't go for it!! Redmi note 8 and even note 5 is much better than it!😤 Completely disappointed 😤😤😤Read more
Awesome product 💎Value for money 💵Best in segment📱For normal usage this one is the best 🙌Long battery life 🤳 when compared to other smartphones.Camera is ok for this price📸Charging is comparitively slow it takes 2 - 2 and half hrs or more to get full charged.🕕 Overall its best for the price👍Read more
Totally impressed by the built and looks. For 13k I thought of getting realme 6i but the stocks barely last..!So I decided to get this phone. The phone is great and smooth. Gaming experience is also good but not as good as g90t.G85 is a decent processor with great daily life performance!If 12k is your budget go for it..Or 13k..realme 6i and 14k... Go for poco m2. Scarlet red looks stunning!!Read more
Very nice Phone.. smooth performance.. charge service decent.. screen quality superb.. sound ok.. but body vibration issue is here.. in speaker mode or at time of calling body vibration present.. no notification light.. overall decent performance at this price.. phone support only 18 watt fast charge. But charger support 22.5 watt..Read more
